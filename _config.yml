  Working at the intersection of teaching, learning and Artificial Intelligence, I am interested in using AI for the benefit of teachers and learners. With a background of eight years of teaching, eight years of corporate training, eight years of K-12 elearning, I am now venturing into AI-driven Instructional Design, an area rich with possibilites for businesses and learners to train and learn effectively at reduced time and costs.
